For Placement

I have implemented the following

1. A **main notekeeper titled notemaker** where you simply add notes and look at them
2. The **admin**, which can see basically everything, needs mysql password which I have set for spefic user (me)

3. A **registration page** which does all sorts of checking if user name is already registered, password is upto standard etc
4. A **login page** which logs in if the user is registered, redirects to notemaker

Note:
The links are not interconnected in an IDEAL way, but the app does what it is required
Passwords are stored encrypted by django internally, mysql encrytion not performed due to time shortage
MYSQL is used and is working as expected

I do not plan to do UI/UX round, however I do have the basic knowledge of required UI/UX

## SPECIAL NOTE 
I have no previous experience working with Django, I have learned it in just past 2 days and done this API

I have knowledge of .NET framework with asp pages and C#, I have done a project in it and also mentioned it in my resume. Project was deployed successfuly by Adani Electricity
